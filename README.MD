Comp 383 scPrediXcan Group Project

1. Quick Background
-The purpose of this repo was to take the scPrediXcan code created by hakyimlab, be able to run it and improve upon it. We are doing this by improving the way that it reads in GWAS files. This by using such tools like difflib and it being able to read in multiple GWAS files. We also improved upon the file by adding to the TWAS Results the gene's chromosome and SNP, this so that it automatically creates a Manhatten plot of the TWAS results.
